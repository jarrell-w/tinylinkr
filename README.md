# TinyLinkr - URL Shortener

## Summary:

This website allows users to take their url and recieve a shorter url.

- **Link to project:** (link)

## How It's Made:

This web app uses DOM manipulation to grab input from the user and upon submit, submit the gathered information to the the shortcode (https://shrtco.de/docs ) api to be converted into a short url.

- **Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Web API

## Possible Optimizations

-A future optimization I'm planning on incorporating is a backend and the ability to allow users to sign in and view saved links. Also would like to find ways to incorporate more interactivity for the user or utilizing the whitespace to add some type of animations.

## Lessons Learned:

-This was a great refresh on the use of some of javascripts es6 functions as well as dom manipulation!
